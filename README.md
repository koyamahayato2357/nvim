This is nvimconfig, a Neovim configuration file that I use for my daily
programming tasks. It is a work in progress and I am constantly updating it. I
have tried to keep it as minimal as possible and have only included the plugins
that I use on a daily basis. I have also tried to keep the configuration as
simple as possible so that it is easy to understand and modify. I have included
comments wherever necessary to explain what each line does. Feel free to use
this configuration file as a starting point for your own Neovim configuration.
If you have any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to open an issue
or a pull request. I would love to hear your feedback. Happy coding!
